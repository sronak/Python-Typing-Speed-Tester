# Python Typing Speed Tester
This is a simple Python program that tests your typing speed. It prompts the user to type a specific word, and records the time it takes for the user to type it correctly. The program also counts any mistakes made during the typing test.

After the user has typed the specified word correctly five times, the program displays a graph of their typing speed evolution. This can be used to track progress and improvement over time.

## How to Use
To use this program, simply run the typing_speed_tester.py file. The program will prompt you to type the word "programming" as fast as you can five times. After each attempt, the program will record the time it took you to type the word, and any mistakes you made.

Once you have typed the word correctly five times, the program will display a graph of your typing speed evolution. This graph shows your typing speed in seconds for each of the five attempts.
